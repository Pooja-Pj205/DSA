# DSA + LeetCode in Java

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** learning repository!  
Here, I practice and solve problems from **LeetCode** using **Java**, while building a strong foundation in DSA concepts.  
This repository is organized by topic-wise folders and includes explanations, code, and my learning notes.
